# Presentation Script for Function Mapping Problem

**[Intro]**

"Good [morning/afternoon], everyone! I’m Jannatul Fatema, and today I’ll be presenting the solution to a problem involving function mappings in the real coordinate plane. This problem will help us explore concepts like **one-to-one** functions, **onto** functions, and **inverses**. Let’s go through each part step-by-step."

---

**[Question Overview]**

"We’re given a function \( F: \mathbb{R} \times \mathbb{R} \to \mathbb{R} \times \mathbb{R} \) defined by:

\[
F(x, y) = (3y - 1, 1 - x)
\]

We need to:
1. Evaluate \( F \) at two specific points.
2. Determine if \( F \) is one-to-one.
3. Check if \( F \) is onto.
4. If it’s a one-to-one correspondence, find the inverse of \( F \).

Let’s start with part (a)."

---

**[Part (a): Evaluate \( F(0, 0) \) and \( F(1, 4) \)]**

"First, we’ll evaluate \( F \) at \( (0, 0) \) and \( (1, 4) \).

For \( F(0, 0) \):
- We plug in \( x = 0 \) and \( y = 0 \):
  \[
  F(0, 0) = (3 * 0 - 1, 1 - 0) = (-1, 1)
  \]

For \( F(1, 4) \):
- Substituting \( x = 1 \) and \( y = 4 \):
  \[
  F(1, 4) = (3 * 4 - 1, 1 - 1) = (11, 0)
  \]

So, \( F(0, 0) = (-1, 1) \) and \( F(1, 4) = (11, 0) \). This part demonstrates how to apply the function to specific values."

---

**[Part (b): Is \( F \) One-to-One ?]**

"Now, let’s determine if \( F \) is one-to-one. A function is one-to-one if \( F(x_1, y_1) = F(x_2, y_2) \) implies \( (x_1, y_1) = (x_2, y_2) \).

Assuming:
\[
F(x_1, y_1) = F(x_2, y_2)
\]
This implies:
\[
(3y_1 - 1, 1 - x_1) = (3y_2 - 1, 1 - x_2)
\]

This gives us two equations:
1. \( 3y_1 - 1 = 3y_2 - 1 \)
2. \( 1 - x_1 = 1 - x_2 \)

From equation 1, we get:
\[
y_1 = y_2
\]

And from equation 2:
\[
x_1 = x_2
\]

Since both \( x \) and \( y \) must be equal, \( F \) is one-to-one."

---

**[Part (c): Is \( F \) Onto ?]**

"Next, we check if \( F \) is onto. To be onto, every point in \( \mathbb{R} \times \mathbb{R} \) must have a pre-image.

Let’s take any point \( (a, b) \) in the output space and see if there’s an \( (x, y) \) such that:
\[
F(x, y) = (a, b)
\]

Expanding \( F(x, y) = (3y - 1, 1 - x) \), we get:
1. \( 3y - 1 = a \)
2. \( 1 - x = b \)

From the first equation:
\[
y = \frac{a + 1}{3}
\]

And from the second:
\[
x = 1 - b
\]

This shows that for any \( (a, b) \), we can find an \( (x, y) \) to match it, proving that \( F \) is onto."

---

**[Part (d): Is \( F \) a One-to-One Correspondence ?]**

"Since \( F \) is both one-to-one and onto, it’s a one-to-one correspondence, or bijective. To complete the problem, let’s find the inverse \( F^{-1} \).

Given \( (a, b) = F(x, y) \), we derived:
\[
y = \frac{a + 1}{3}
\]
and
\[
x = 1 - b
\]

So the inverse function is:
\[
F^{-1}(a, b) = \left(1 - b, \frac{a + 1}{3}\right)
\]

This inverse allows us to retrieve the original inputs from any outputs."

---

**[Conclusion]**

"To summarize, we evaluated specific values of \( F \), proved that \( F \) is one-to-one and onto, and found its inverse. Understanding these properties gives us insight into function mappings and transformations in the real coordinate plane.

Thank you for listening, and I’m happy to answer any questions!"
