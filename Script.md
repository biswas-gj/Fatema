Here's a detailed script for presenting these solutions in a clear and professional manner for your YouTube audience:

**[Intro]**

"Hey everyone! Welcome back to the channel. Today, we’re going to dive into a problem involving functions and transformations in the real coordinate plane. We’ll break down each part step-by-step, so by the end, you’ll have a solid understanding of one-to-one functions, onto functions, and inverses."

---

**[Question Overview]**

"Let’s look at the problem statement. We have a function \( F: \mathbb{R} \times \mathbb{R} \to \mathbb{R} \times \mathbb{R} \) defined by:

\[
F(x, y) = (3y - 1, 1 - x)
\]

Our goal is to work through four parts:
1. Evaluate \( F \) at two points.
2. Determine if \( F \) is one-to-one.
3. Check if \( F \) is onto.
4. If it’s a one-to-one correspondence, find the inverse function.

Let’s tackle each of these one-by-one."

---

**[Part (a): Evaluate \( F(0, 0) \) and \( F(1, 4) \)]**

"First, we’ll evaluate \( F \) at the points \( (0, 0) \) and \( (1, 4) \).

For \( F(0, 0) \):
- Plugging \( x = 0 \) and \( y = 0 \) into \( F(x, y) = (3y - 1, 1 - x) \), we get:
  \[
  F(0, 0) = (3 \cdot 0 - 1, 1 - 0) = (-1, 1)
  \]
So, \( F(0, 0) = (-1, 1) \).

For \( F(1, 4) \):
- Substituting \( x = 1 \) and \( y = 4 \), we find:
  \[
  F(1, 4) = (3 \cdot 4 - 1, 1 - 1) = (12 - 1, 0) = (11, 0)
  \]
Thus, \( F(1, 4) = (11, 0) \).

That was straightforward—just plugging in values and simplifying!"

---

**[Part (b): Is \( F \) One-to-One?]**

"Now, let’s determine if \( F \) is a one-to-one function. Recall, a function is one-to-one if \( F(x_1, y_1) = F(x_2, y_2) \) implies \( (x_1, y_1) = (x_2, y_2) \).

So, let’s assume:
\[
F(x_1, y_1) = F(x_2, y_2)
\]
This means:
\[
(3y_1 - 1, 1 - x_1) = (3y_2 - 1, 1 - x_2)
\]

Breaking it down, we get two equations:
1. \( 3y_1 - 1 = 3y_2 - 1 \)
2. \( 1 - x_1 = 1 - x_2 \)

From the first equation, we can cancel \(-1\) on both sides, giving:
\[
3y_1 = 3y_2 \Rightarrow y_1 = y_2
\]

Similarly, the second equation simplifies to:
\[
x_1 = x_2
\]

Since both \( x \) and \( y \) are equal, we conclude that if \( F(x_1, y_1) = F(x_2, y_2) \), then \( (x_1, y_1) = (x_2, y_2) \). Therefore, \( F \) is indeed one-to-one."

---

**[Part (c): Is \( F \) Onto?]**

"Next, we check if \( F \) is onto, which means every point in the output space \( \mathbb{R} \times \mathbb{R} \) has a corresponding input point in \( \mathbb{R} \times \mathbb{R} \).

To prove this, we take an arbitrary output point \( (a, b) \) and see if there exists \( (x, y) \) such that:
\[
F(x, y) = (a, b)
\]

Expanding \( F(x, y) = (3y - 1, 1 - x) \), we need:
1. \( 3y - 1 = a \)
2. \( 1 - x = b \)

From the first equation, solving for \( y \), we get:
\[
y = \frac{a + 1}{3}
\]

And from the second equation, solving for \( x \), we get:
\[
x = 1 - b
\]

Since we can find \( x \) and \( y \) for any values of \( a \) and \( b \), \( F \) is onto, mapping all points in \( \mathbb{R} \times \mathbb{R} \)."

---

**[Part (d): Is \( F \) a One-to-One Correspondence?]**

"Finally, let’s determine if \( F \) is a one-to-one correspondence, meaning both one-to-one and onto. Since we’ve shown that \( F \) is both, it is indeed a one-to-one correspondence, or bijective.

To complete this, let’s find the inverse \( F^{-1} \). Given:
\[
F(x, y) = (3y - 1, 1 - x)
\]
we want to express \( x \) and \( y \) in terms of \( a \) and \( b \) where \( (a, b) = F(x, y) \).

From our previous steps:
- We found that \( y = \frac{a + 1}{3} \).
- We also found that \( x = 1 - b \).

So the inverse function is:
\[
F^{-1}(a, b) = \left(1 - b, \frac{a + 1}{3}\right)
\]

This inverse function allows us to recover the original inputs from any output point."
